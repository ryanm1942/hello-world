Hello. My name is Ryan Morley.
I am 26 years old.
Engaged to be married. 

I have a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the greatest little University in the world: Georgia Southern University.
GO EAGLES!!!

I'm an avid sports fan with my two favorite teams being the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Portland Trailblazers. No there is no geographical relationship with those two teams. 

I have 3 cats (Gucci, Monkey, and Toby) and 2 dogs (Geoffrey and Charlie) both pit mixes. 

My biggest hobby would be videogames and right now I mainly play Destiny. 

I want to begin to learn more programming languages other than Python. Game Design would be the ultimate end goal for me as a programmmer but first I would like to focus on mathematics and data analysis.
